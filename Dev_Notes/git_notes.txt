Git 101

Step 1: Install git

Step 2: Setup git to the github remote URL
git config --global user.name <Your name>
git config --local user.email <Your email>

Step 3: create a folder on your local machine where you would like to see the files mapped to GITHUB repo

Step 4: run: git init dictory/path

Step 5: link your remote repository to git
git clone <repo link here> (optional)
git remote add <a name for repo> <remote url>

Step 6: Sync your local directory with the files from the GITHUB by following command
git pull origin master

Step 7: add a "new file or folder" to your local repository and then link it to the branch by following command
git add filename

Step 8: upload the updated local repository to the online github by following command (remember to do commit first. check step 9)
git push origin branchname
branchname is master by default

Step 9: make changes to exiting file of the repository and upload it to github. Lets say we made change to blah.txt file
git commit path/blah.txt
git push origin branchname


Useful commands:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
List the contents of a branch:
git ls-tree branchname

List the git configuration for the directory:
git config --list

See the changes you have made to file to the one on the server (try to do this before you git add any changes):
git diff filepath/filename

List all remote urls:
git remote -v

remove a file from repository:
git rm filepath/filename
git commit reponame branchname
git push reponame branchname

give a meaningful local name to the remote git repo which is by default called "origin":
git rename origin <new name>

remove git repo locally
rmdir /s .git

if you have some local changes that you don't want to commit, and you would like to pull to latest. Do:
git stash
git pull
git stash pop
git push (if there are any committed changes that you would like to push)
